# Handwriting Recognition 

This machine learning project aims to recognize hand-written names from images using a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network). The project also utilizes the CTC Loss function, which is best known for text recognition problems. Because the dataset is too large to be added to GitHub successfully, a link to the dataset has been provided in the notebook. 

#### Dependencies Used: 
1. Tensorflow/Keras (Machine Learning) 
2. NumPy (Linear Algebra)
3. Pandas (Data Preprocessing) 
4. MatPlotLib (Data Plotting) 
5. OpenCV (Image Preprocessing)
6. Built-In Python Libraries (OS and Random)

#### How To View/Add-On This Project:

If you would like to merely view this project, just view the code and output on GitHub's file viewer. If you would like to use/add-on the actual project, please download the project. Then, change your directory in the terminal to where the downloaded folder is and install all of the Pip packages with the ```requirements.txt``` file using the following command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Then, type in the following command: ```jupyter notebook```. This will open up a window in your browser. Then click on the file that is called: ```handwriting_recognition.ipynb```. Then, if all packages are installed, you can click on ```Cell``` in the Jupyter Notebook menu and click ```Run All```. 

Enjoy!
